# QuizzMe
A simple trivia app based on the code found in the Udemy course 
"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" by 
Dr. Angela Yu. (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

Uses Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/) as the source
of questions.

Some additions to the original code are:
1) Added menu to the main window
![Main Window with Menu](https://github.com/EMS-PI/quizzme/raw/master/images/quizme_main_window_with_menu.png)
2) Added a setup dialog to choose category, difficulty and number of questions. Utilized sticky="EW" to solve layout problems
3) Added quit confirmation
4) Fixed multiple click bug
