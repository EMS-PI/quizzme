# QuizzMe
A simple trivia app based on the code found in the Udemy course 
"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" by 
Dr. Angela Yu. (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

Uses Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/) as the source
of questions.

Some additions to the original code are:
1) Added question counter

3) Added a setup dialog to choose category, difficulty and number of questions. Utilized sticky="EW" to solve layout problems
